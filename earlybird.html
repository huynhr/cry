      <p > <strong> Early Bird  </strong> is an interactive web based mobile game that engages guests prior to
        a live show at the Vancouver TheatreSports League. The goal is to encourage people to arrive

        <div class="small-text"><h3>CONTEXT</h3></div>
        <p>This project was created within a design research course where the focus was learning ethnographic
           research methods.
          We had the opportunity to work with the <a href="http://www.vtsl.com/">Vancouver Theatre Sports League</a>
          over the span of 3 months with frequent meetings to create a final proposal that included a prototype,
           a video proposal, and research document.

        <p>In this team project, my specific roles included <strong>field research, developing insights, conducting interviews,
          and contributing towards developing the UI and interactions </strong>. Primary tools I used were Sketch, Principle, Photoshop, and Illustrator. </p>

      <h3>VTSL</h3>
        <p>
          Vancouver TheatreSports League is a professional theatre organization whose mission is to challenge and
          inspire the community through improv-based work.</strong> The improv shows consists of two teams of actors
          that compete against each other on stage and perform improvised scenarios.
          They are overseen by a referee, who acts as a host and mediator for the show.
          Our team was tasked with conducting ethnographic research to help improve the show going experience for the attendees.

    <h3>Research</h3>
    <p> With the primary goal of this course is learning research methods, we spent majority of our time gathering
      insights through interviews, ethnographic observations, cultural probes and participatory workshops.

        <h4>Ethnography</h4>
        <p>Based on our observations of guests during  the pre-show, we observed that <strong>the long, narrow layout of the space
          created a lot of congestion points, particularly around the theatre doors & the bar area.</strong> We also noticed that
          staff would have to spend time organizing clusters of people, & maneuvering around guests to access certain
          staff areas, impeding their workflow.</p>

          <h4>Cultural Probes</h4>
          <p>Our team crafted 4 sets of cultural probes with tools that would allow us to learn about the show going
            experience from the perspective of the attendee and staff in a fun and engaging way.  </p>
          <p>We learnt the <strong>first time show attendees felt disconnected and nervous before
            the show starts as they are not sure what to expect.</strong></p>

        <div class="col1of2">
          <h4>Participatory Workshop</h4>
          <p>Lastly, our team conducted a participatory workshop with mini-activities for the VTSL staff.
            The goal of the activities was to identify issues and co-design possible solutions.
            Interestingly, there were more insights uncovered through the staff discussing about
            their experiences with one another than through the activities themselves.
           </p>
          <p>An important insight uncovered from these conversations was that <strong> some (first time) attendees
            aren't aware of the improv theatre etiquette- specifically around timeliness. </strong>
            As such, some guests tend to arrive at the show late, disrupting the actors' flow of performance.
            To avoid this issue, some late comers are requested to wait outside the theatre until the next act or intermission.

    <h3>How Might We?</h3>
    </div>
    <section>
    <p>Based on the insights we gathered, we framed the following how might we questions to help us ideate for possible ways to intervene.</p>
     <h4><div class="blue-text">01/ </div>How might we encourage people to arrive on time by increasing the entertainment value of the pre-show experience? </h4>
     <h4><div class="blue-text">02/ </div>How might we mitigate the feeling of being “unsure what to expect” for newcomers?</h4>
     <h4><div class="blue-text">03/ </div> How might we create a buffer that prevent late comers from missing the actors’ performance without compromising punctual customers’ experience?</h4>

      <h3>Goal</h3>
    </div>
        <section>
      <p>Being aware of the issues and insights we learnt from our research methods, we wanted our intervention to accomplish the following goals:</p>
        <h4><div class="blue-text">01/ </div>Create a social dwelling space within the theatre to reduce crowds in the hallways.</h4>
        <h4><div class="blue-text">02/ </div>Embody improv theatre’s unique culture: spontaneous, collaborative, creative, and participatory.</h4>
        <h4><div class="blue-text">03/ </div>Ease guests into the improv culture by priming them to engage with onstage performers.</h4>

    <h3>The idea </h3>
    <p>Similar to <a href="https://timeplay.com/"> TimePlay,</a> Early Bird is an interactive mobile game that engages guests 10-15 minutes prior to the live show encouraging them to arrive at
      the venue in a timely manner. Guests are encouraged to congregate in the theater, reducing the crowds in the hallways.
      The game structure mimics the improv show culture, priming the audience for live show.
      Winners of the game will receive prizes such as drink vouchers or show tickets.  </p>

    <img src="img/earlybird/structure.png" width="60%">

    <p>We wanted our interventiion to have the following attributes:</p>
    <p><strong>Front and Back of house:</strong>
      The host is an integral part of the transition from pre-show to in-show experience for guiding and priming the audience.
      We aim to help the host more easily prep the audience for the show and provide them with a novel method of engaging
      the crowd. We also wanted to include the backstage crew such as the sound and the visual technician, as they play a vital
      role in supporting the actor's live performance.</p>
    <p><strong>Competitive Teams:</strong>
      The two-team set up reflects the style of TheatreSports where the teams compete for victory. The audience is allowed to choose their team, instead of
      splitting the teams arbitrarily, to encourage conversation and competition amongst groups of friends.
