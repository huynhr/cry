    <div class="small-text col1of2"><h3>CONTEXT</h3></div>
    <p> This is a process-focused, speculative project done over the span of 20 hours from start to finish.
      Just to provide some background information on my process - I was working full-time as a nurse (my side hustle).
      So I worked shift duty every day and had to schedule and manage my time accordingly.
      I finished this project in 20 hours over the span of 5 days.

      <h3 >Dissecting the Brief</h3>

     <p> With the design principles in mind, we explored visual approaches that would complement the abstracted calendar metaphor and the content we produced.
      <strong>We were inspired by the dutch designer, Wim Crouwel-  his virtue of functionalism that prioritizes practicality, clarity, and simplicity
      over artistic ornamentation.</strong> This implored the exploration of grids, simple shapes, and contrasting typography.

    <h3>UX + INTERACTION DESIGN</h3>
    <p> With our well defined design principles and a visual approach in mind,
      we worked to explore ideas and translate our vision into a website. Through a lateral process of ideating
      and user testing, we constantly iterated on the website to work out the interactions and finer details.
      During user testing we found ourselves needing to constantly tweak the website to meet
      the audience's expectations and to follow good UX practice. While it is important to reduce frictions and
      aim to produce an intuitive experience, we took an unapologetic stance towards our
      design decisions, uncompromising of our identity.
      The result was a website that embodied our design principles of experimental, unapologetic and ambiguous.

        <h3>Glimpse into their world</h3>
        <p> Our goal with the homepage was to entice the viewer as if they were stepping into the designer's studio.
          We did this by surfacing full-bleed video portraits on hover, which would immediately give the viewers a sense of who the designer is.
          This also incentivizes viewers before committing to watching the interview.

        <h3>Films + Field Notes</h3>
        <p> We utilized the calendar metaphor to lay out the films and field notes in the chronological order we experienced it.
          The duo shaped circles were used to divide the content between designer interviews and our field school anecdotes.
          The toggle feature allows the viewer to swap between the two content states where the circles change in size.

          <h3>Legacy</h3>
          <p>Past field school websites hosted an archive of interviews linking out to their respective websites.
            This year, we wanted to showcase past years' brand and their unique quality; This was our way of
            showing appreciation and acknowledging the privilege we have of being a part of this legacy program.
           <p>
           <p>
             Our challenge was to create a cohesive experience which was in line with our visual identity while
             also allowing each year to have its own voice. This was achieved through a hover interaction that revealed their identity.

        <h3> Feature Placement</h3>
        <p> We realized the camera screen was accessible through 3 different areas of the app.
           So we conducted A/B testing with 3 different entry points to evaluate the most efficient placement/engagement for this feature.
           5 out of the 7 participants expected the feature to be found be the search bar due to the association with the action searching an object. </p>

    <p> Having had minimal experience in videography and production prior to field school,
      I challenged myself to learn how to shoot and craft a compelling visual narrative.
      I had the humbling opportunity to research and interview the inspiring <a href="https://www.nienkehoogvliet.nl/"> Nienke Hoogvliet</a>,
      and produce short video that explains her philosophy and approach.
